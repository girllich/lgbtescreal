# LGBTESCREAL

SVG files for an "LGBTESCREAL" symbol.

LGBTESCREAL is a fusion of the acronyms [LGBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ) and [TESCREAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TESCREAL).

The symbol consists of the [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) logo compass in [trans flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_flag) colors, within a [rainbow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_flag_(LGBTQ)) gear, on a black background.

The symbol was originally designed by @tetraspace, @dawnlightmelody, and @kalamandrens, and [first posted on X/Twitter](https://x.com/kalamandrens/status/1800307999283753278). It was converted to SVG by @girllich in Inkscape, and the SVG source was later edited by @ilzolende.

## Variations

lgbtescreal-plain.svg is the original symbol or so. lgbtescreal-transparent.svg is a semi-transparent version of it. lgbtescreal-involute-12.svg uses an involute-ish 12-toothed gear shape from [Nevit Dilmen's public domain image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gears.svg). lgbtescreal-gilbert-baker.svg uses the 8-stripe Gilbert Baker flag and an involute-ish 16-toothed gear shape from the same source.
